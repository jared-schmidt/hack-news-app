Hack news Meteor.js Cordova App using React.js

# Install
Need to have meteor setup along with Cordova follow this guide from Meteor https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Meteor-Cordova-Phonegap-integration

# run
`meteor run android`
for extra debug log add `--verbose` after "android"

# Known Problem
- [ ] When link is open. It opens it over top of the whole app. Would like if it would display in something like a iframe and can display header bar with back button. For now need to use the back button on the phone
